//! `SkTiledImageUtils`' [`self::draw_image()`]/[`self::draw_image_rect()`] methods are intended
//! to be direct replacements for their [`Canvas`] equivalents. The `SkTiledImageUtils` calls will
//! break [`crate::Bitmap`]-backed [`Image`]s into smaller tiles and draw them if the original
//! image is too large to be uploaded to the GPU. If the original image doesn't need tiling or is
//! already gpu-backed the [`self::draw_image()`]/[`self::draw_image_rect()`] calls will fall
//! through to the matching [`Canvas`] call.
